2021, What a blasting start it has been to the new year. We were at Zion doing the Angels landing hike at 5790 feet with snow capped trail, spikes on our shoes and fear in our minds. The fact that 10 people have already lost their lives trying to reach the summit there itself creates a part of the fear. But that’s why we were there. I know it sounds cliche but if not for the fear of slipping, the fear of death then the hike seemed just like any other one, with prompts like metallic chains to assist the hikers. It was an amazing experience, with the cold winds and the serene views at the top. But the best part was the feeling of achievement, 
> the realization that fear is and always will exist, but we can always fight it and win!!
First day of the year and we were in the narrows. A completely different environment which I have never experienced before. The huge canyons and walking in knee deep water. There was no elevation, but the water flow itself was enough to give us a tough time. Rated as one of the best hikes, the narrows stood up to its reputation. the texture and the color of the rocks, the confounding shapes and the distorted faces. Poor me started making stories as if the rocks were shaped to give us humans a message. A message which has been formed over thousands and thousands of years. A personal note from nature. Maybe it did, a very simple one though, which we all know! That every thing will keep changing, the water level, the air flow, the texture, the rocks and so will life. So lets enjoy the moment and make this one of the best year for ourselves!!
